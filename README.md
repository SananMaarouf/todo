# Todo app ðŸš€

This is my todo app made with React Native, Expo Go and Expo Router. 

It is my starting point for creating universal mobile apps using JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code inside a JavaScript file.

# My goal

In the beginning, my goal with this app is to create a functional and nice looking todo app that runs on Android/iOS.
